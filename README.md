# React Front End for anchor Program
Here I created a front end for the anchor program written in https://github.com/chubi-x/anchor-program   
It uses react components created by Solana and anchor to connect solana wallets to the front end so users can run transactions   
Following the structure of the anchor program, this front end initializes a count, increments it, decrements it, and sets it to a value provided in the code.
